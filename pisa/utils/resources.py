def find_resource(resource, fail=True):
    """Try to find a resource (file or directory).

    First check if `resource` is an absolute path, then check relative to
    the paths specified by the PISA_RESOURCES environment variable (if it is
    defined). Otherwise, look in the resources directory of the PISA
    installation.

    Note that the PISA_RESOURCES environment variable can contain multiple
    paths, each separated by a colon. Due to using colons as separators,
    however, the paths themselves can *not* contain colons.

    Note also if PISA is packaged as archive distribution (e.g. zipped egg),
    this method extracts the resource (if directory, the entire contents are
    extracted) to a temporary cache directory. Therefore, it is preferable to
    use the `open_resource` method directly, and avoid this method if possible.


    Parameters
    ----------
    resource : str
        Resource path; can be path relative to CWD, path relative to
        PISA_RESOURCES environment variable (if defined), or a package resource
        location relative to the `pisa_examples/resources` sub-directory. Within
        each path specified in PISA_RESOURCES and within the
        `pisa_examples/resources` dir, the sub-directories 'data', 'scripts',
        and 'settings' are checked for `resource` _before_ the base directories
        are checked. Note that the **first** result found is returned.

    fail : bool
        If True, raise IOError if resource not found
        If False, return None if resource not found


    Returns
    -------
    String if `resource` is found (relative path to the file or directory); if
    not found and `fail` is False, returns None.


    Raises
    ------
    IOError if `resource` is not found and `fail` is True.

    Parameters

        PISA_RESOURCES environment variable (if defined), or a package resource

    mode : str

    Returns
    -------

    --------
    find_resource

        resource

    find_path

        Open a (file) package resource and return stream object.
